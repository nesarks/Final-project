    "### Don't do any changes nigga. I have decided to change sum stuff. made random forest model 100 accurate. i will collect nifty50,smallcap,midcap and sum mutual funds. i will preprocess it and use metrics like \n",
    "for stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Volatility\n",
    "   - Description: Measures the degree of variation in a trading price series over time, indicating the risk associated with an asset.\n",
    "   - Use: Helps determine how much the price of an asset is likely to fluctuate, aiding in risk assessment for different investment strategies (e.g., aggressive strategies may favor higher volatility).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "   - Description: Calculates risk-adjusted return by comparing the excess return of the investment to its volatility.\n",
    "   - Use: A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance, helping users identify which investments provide the most return for their risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maximum Drawdown\n",
    "   - Description: Represents the largest drop from a peak to a trough in the value of an investment.\n",
    "   - Use: Helps assess potential losses in a worst-case scenario, providing insight into the downside risk of investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cumulative Returns\n",
    "   - Description: Shows the total change in the value of an investment over a specific period.\n",
    "   - Use: Useful for understanding long-term performance and for comparing the historical performance of different investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Beta\n",
    "   - Description: Measures the sensitivity of a stock's returns to market returns (usually compared to a market index like Nifty 50).\n",
    "   - Use: Helps assess how much risk the stock adds to a diversified portfolio. A beta greater than 1 indicates higher risk, while less than 1 indicates lower risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "for mutual funds\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expense Ratio\n",
    "   - Description: The percentage of a fund's assets that are used for administrative and management expenses.\n",
    "   - Use: Lower expense ratios are generally preferable, as they indicate that a smaller portion of returns is eaten away by fees, which can significantly impact long-term performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alpha\n",
    "   - Description: Measures the excess return of a mutual fund relative to the return of a benchmark index (e.g., Nifty 50).\n",
    "   - Use: A positive alpha indicates that the fund has outperformed its benchmark after adjusting for risk, while a negative alpha indicates underperformance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation\n",
    "   - Description: Measures the volatility of the fund's returns over a specific period.\n",
    "   - Use: Helps assess the risk associated with the mutual fund. A higher standard deviation indicates higher volatility, which may be suitable for aggressive investment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "   - Description: Similar to stocks, the Sharpe Ratio for mutual funds compares the fundâ€™s excess return to its standard deviation.\n",
    "   - Use: It helps investors understand the risk-adjusted return of the mutual fund, allowing for comparisons across different funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cumulative Returns\n",
    "   - Description: The total return of the mutual fund over a specified period, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "   - Use: Provides a clear picture of how well the fund has performed over time, enabling users to compare its historical performance against peers or benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "after calculating all these based on user preference and the predicted investment strategy will map with the metrcs like high volatility stocks = aggressive/moderatly aggressive etc. "
